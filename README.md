# OData Batch operations with Kendo UI

## Usage

Include "kendo.data.odata-batch.js" in your page after all other Kendo UI scripts. Use 'odata-v4' or 'odata' as data source type.

The endpoint of the OData service is either set via the `batchUrl` option or determined from `options.read.url`. In addition some v3 services may require specifying the type of the entity via the [type option](index.html#L107)

> The original v2 'odata' transport is replaced with a v3 one.
